COUNT_OF_2
Assignment name  : count_of_2
Expected files   : count_of_2.c
Allowed functions: None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement a function which counts, for a given integer n, the number of 2s
that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).
Your function must be declared as follows:
int    count_of_2(int n);
If n <= 1, the function returns 0;
Examples:
input  = 25
output =  9
because there are 9 2s in (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25)
Note:
the number 22 counts as 2 because it has two 2s, number 202 count as 2, number 22022 count as 4 etcâ€¦
